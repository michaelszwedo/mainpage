                          <p><b>Yoga helps to improve physical fitness, mental clarity, greater self-understanding and general well-being.</b> 
                          <p>It is the union of mind and body focuses on the physical postures called "asanas", breathing exercises called "pranayama" <br>
                            and meditation.<br>
                            Our Yoga class helps to improve physical fitness utilizing strength, flexibility and stamina.</p>
                          <p>Yoga may help reverse heart disease and can help with balance in older folks. Just two sessions of Hatha yoga per week can increase stability.
                              Yoga can improve balance in people under 60 years old too.<br>
                              It has long been used for relieving stress and improving mood. Plus, since some people overeat due to stress, conquering stress with yoga might 
                              indirectly improve nutrition. </p>
                          <p>You will be taught throughout the program how to use all the above technique and many more.
                          <br>Our yoga instructors have large background, qualifications, experience and completed a training course.</p>

                            calm. It is a great exercise to do if you are returning to fitness after a break or as a complement to other types of exercise.</p>
                          Our workout builds flexibility and strength and leaves. A fusion of gentle yoga-based exercises, our Stretch and Relax instructors show you 
                            how to perform a series of stretches and breathing exercises. 
                            <br>Moves and poses are set to relaxing music, creating an environment of peace and calm. Through controlled breathing exercises, you learn how to focus and quieten the mind. 
                          <p>In class, we may use foam rollers to help release tightness
                              in the muscles as well as increase the range of motion and balance the body. </p>

                            <p><b>People go to the gym and do strength training for a number of reasons, for bigger muscles, for more toned muscles and for actual physical 
                              strength and power.</b></p>
                            <p>You can choose to do your own strength training workout on the gym floor, training with your personal trainer, 
                              or to do a group exercise class that has strength training includes or focuses exclusively on it.</p> 
                            <p> A strength training class can be a great way to ensure you are training safely, avoiding injury and training the right way 
                              to get the specific results you are after.</p>

                        <a id="HIIT"></a>  
                          <h2>HIIT</h2>
                            <p><b>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a broad term for workouts that involve short periods of intense exercise alternated with recovery
                              periods.</b>
                            <p>One of the biggest advantages of HIIT is that you can get maximal health benefits in minimal time.
                                HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise alternated with low-intensity recovery periods. 
                                Typically, a HIIT workout will range from 10 to 30 minutes in duration.</p> 
                            <p>Despite how short the workout is, it can produce health benefits similar to twice as much moderate-intensity exercise. 
                              The actual activity being performed varies but can include sprinting, biking, jump rope or other body weight exercises.
                              <br>For example, a HIIT workout using a stationary exercise bike could consist of 30 seconds of cycling as fast as possible against high resistance, 
                               followed by several minutes of slow, easy cycling with low resistance.
                              This would be considered one "round" or "repetition" of HIIT, and you would typically complete 4 to 6 repetitions in one workout.</p>
                            <p> The specific amount of time you exercise and recover will vary based on the activity you choose and how intensely you are exercising.</p>

                          <p><b>CrossFit is a wildly popular approach to what some consider extreme fitness.</b></p>
                          <p>It mixes exercise and dietary changes in order to build strength and/or lose weight. 
                            The workout can be modified depending on your fitness level and goals. </p>
                          <p> Because CrossFit moves can be modified to fit nearly any fitness level, it’s said to be appropriate for just about everyone 
                              — young and old, fit and not so fit. But when starting with CrossFit, the best advice is to start slowly and work your way up. </p>

                        <p> RPM is a great way to build up your sense of personal achievement. You can draw on the group’s energy and find your rhythm in the music.

                            you’re participating in the exercise. And since Zumba involves the movement of the entire body — from your arms to your shoulders and to your 
                            feet — you’ll get a full-body workout that doesn’t feel like work.</p>

                      <p>The formula for a Tabata workout is simple: 20 seconds of all-out effort, followed by 10 seconds of rest.  This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each exercise. 
                        It sounds simple and short, don't make the mistake of thinking that it's easier. 
                      <br>These efforts will require max effort.Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it's likely to be one
                        of the longest four minutes you've ever endured.</p>
                      <p>You can do pretty much any exercise you wish. You can do squats, push-ups, burpees or any other exercise that works for your large muscle groups.
                          Kettlebell exercises work great, too.</p>
                      <p>Our personal trainers are health and fitness enthusiasts and who place massive value on advanced, high-intensity training techniques.
                        We want to pass this knowledge and expertise onto others like you in order to help you to get the very most from them and learn how you can incorporate them 
                        into your own personal health and fitness regime.</p>

                    <p><b>We all know that what you eat is important. But what about when you eat?  Especially if you’re active?. Our licensed nutritionists and dietitians
                     and give you practical recommendations for what to eat before, during, and after exercise.</b></p>
                    <p>We prepare your personal diet plan according to recommendations by a goal and body type (though we’d emphasize goal over body type).</p> 
                    <p><i>What is your goal?</i></p>  
                    <p><i>Getting ready for a fitness competition.</i>  You accumulate a lot of exercise hours. You’re trying to drop to a single-digit body fat percentage. 
                          For you, carb intake should be lower. You’d benefit from the performance-enhancing, muscle-preserving essential amino acids (EAA) during your training.</p>
                    <p><i>An endurance athlete.</i> You train for high-level competition. You log a lot of high-intensity miles each week. For you, carbohydrate and calorie 
                      needs are likely higher. </p>
                    <p> <i>Training as a bodybuilder.</i> You lift weights with serious muscle growth in mind. You want to gain weight.
                        Your protein and calorie needs are likely higher.</p>
                    <p><i>At Mind and body classes</i> a proper diet that includes nutritious food delivers the optimal amounts of nutrients to your body when you are engaged. </p>
                    <p>Your body can’t produce all those nutrients on its own, and therefore it’s important to consume good food that supports a lifestyle and to refine
                       and solidify the results and eating habits you want to achieve.</p>
                    <p>Fill your daily diet with proper nutrients to component the physical engagement, not only will you notice a significant improvement in performance
                       as well as a mood. It will also help to fight the effects of aging.</p>
                    <p>Our diet doctor proper optimal diet for you and tells you how to change eating habits. We also recommend an application on your smartphone, 
                         where you'll see your personally monitoring fitness progress like your daily calories burned or distance travelled.</p>
