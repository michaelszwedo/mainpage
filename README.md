## General info
My Main website was created to show a few of my web projects, information about me and contact information.
On my main page, all graphics are created by myself. On my other websites, I've been using graphics and photos what I've made by myself as well as pictures from photos bank.
All that you see in the main page was created by self including the main page too. The pages were created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. They don't have back-end (PHP, SQL, etc. files)

Projects called "T-Rex- Hockey Store" and "Shape Up! Gym and Fitness Centre" are imaginary company websites. 
The purpose of the project is presenting my visual and coding skills. Websites are without back-end. They were created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The "Pure CSS illustration was created during "Hackathon" and was focused on CSS, especially on transforms, transition and animation in CSS. The page is without responsivity. It was created using only HTML, CSS.

The last project called "Joanna Kruszynska-Szwedo - violinist" is my wife website what I've created for her. It is not coding myself, 
it was created using a template from "wixsite". Website content and design (graphics, photos, music, movie) was created by myself.

I have strong motivation and I am focused and concerned on Design and Develop Websites, as well as a Web Application and software development process, I have a lot of ideas about websites and applications. I am constantly improving my knowledge about user interface design and coding development and all that is related to Information Technology.
