## General info
My Main website was created to present a few of my web projects, information about me and contact information.
On my main page, all graphics are created by myself. In my other websites I've been using graphics and photos what I've made as well as pictures from photos bank.
All pages what you see on the main page was created by self include the main page.

Projects called "T-Rex- Hockey Store" and "Shape Up! Gym and Fitness Centre" are imaginary company webpages. 
The purpose of the project is presenting my visual and coding skills. Websites are without back-end. They were created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The "Pure CSS illustration was created during "Hackathon" and was focused on CSS, especially on transforms, transition and animation in CSS. Page is 
without responsivity.

The last project called "Joanna Kruszynska-Szwedo - violinist" is my wife website what I've created for her. It is not coding myself, 
it was created using a template from "wixsite". Webpage content and design (graphics, photos, music, movie) was created by myself.

I have strong motivation and I am focused and concerned on Design and Develop Websites, as well as a Web Application and software development process, I have a lot of ideas 
about websites and applications and I am going to develop, add and share it.
